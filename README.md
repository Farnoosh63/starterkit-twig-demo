# Demo StarterKit for Twig

This StarterKit is meant to be used as a demo that highlights how to combine Twig and Pattern Lab. It is currently very thin. We're looking for maintainers who may be interested in making this demo the equal to if not better than the Mustache demo.

## Install

This StarterKit can be installed using the following command:

    php core/console --starterkit --install pattern-lab/starterkit-twig-demo

It is recommended that you **do not** install this StarterKit as a dependency for your Pattern Lab project via Composer.

## Edit Files

After installation the files for this StarterKit can be found in `source/`.

## Maintainers Wanted

Interested in making the Twig demo match the Mustache demo? Drop us a note in the issues.
